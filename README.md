# 404BrainNotFound

    To-do list:
    Plan :
    =====================Mid break & wk 10=====================
    ===============Preparation ==============
    Come up with a scenario
    Select the Data sources that would help fulfil your scenario
    Opinion:kaggle is good
    ========================================
    Perform Data Integration and pre-processing if needed .
    Building a machine learning model to fulfil the scenario (using the dataset that you have prepared for training and evaluation)
    Not sure now: how to do the machine learning
    ============================wk 11===========================
    Designing a RESTful API to allow the consumption of your service ( you need to consider an authentication scheme for the consumers of your service)
    Point: authentication

    Mentor meeting one(3 marks)
    ============================wk 12===========================
    Designing a Simple Client with GUI (you are free to use whatever you like whether it is a simple HTML- java-script , ASP, php, JSP, JSF, or even window-based interfaces )

        Montor meeting two(3 marks)
    =========================================================


    (6 marks) Mentor meeting(wk11,12)
    Meeting One - more or so complete design documentation (10% of the total mark).

    (3 marks) Points to be discussed/assessed:  
    ‐ Has the group established an effective communication channel (only in English) for group work? (e.g., messaging, code repository)  
    ‐ Has the group established the roles and tasks necessary for the group work?  
    ‐ Has the group identified datasets to use the Data Analytics Service?  
    ‐ Has the group identified the use‐case scenario for the Data Analytics Service application? (i.e.,  what is the service going to offer for the users?)    
    ‐ Has the group identified the (high‐level) system architecture and components necessary for the group work?  (not to be detailed, high‐level plan)    

    Notes: Bring one‐page document with following information:  
    ‐ What is the aim of the service?  
    ‐ What are the datasets?  
    ‐ What is your communication channel?  
    ‐ What is your code repository?  
    ‐ A very brief description of each member’s role in the project
    Meeting Two - an early implementation of the service , demo of work in progress (10% of the total mark).
    Happen in wk12, nearly due, maybe we should finish it and ask for feedback from the mentor, only do improvement rather than new coding.

    (3 marks) Points to be discussed/assessed:  
    ‐ Is the group maintaining an effective communication channel for group work? (e.g., messaging,  code repository)  
    ‐ Is the group tracking the roles and tasks necessary for the group work? (i.e., is everybody fulfilling their tasks on time, and is there a mechanism in place to resolve problems?)  
    ‐ Is the implementation progressing towards the planned scenario?     

    Notes:  
    ‐ Each student separately should talk about their roles and how they have made progress  
    ‐ Present your communication channel (Should be only in English)   
    ‐ Present your code repository
